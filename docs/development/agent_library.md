# Agent libraries and pin maintenance

The discovery/routing document is [`agents/README.md`](../../agents/README.md).
Both agent-skills and QuantSmith are available; project/user instructions take
precedence. QuantSmith supplies relevant quant/data role guidance through a
configurable external reference, while agent-skills is fully vendored here.

## agent-skills snapshot

`agents/agent-skills/` is a complete local snapshot stored as ordinary files in
this repository. It is not a Git submodule and contains no nested Git metadata.
Normal checkouts include the skills, references, helper scripts, and MIT license;
using or verifying them requires no GitHub access or refresh.

The pin is `f63ec56a3cc936408d792956ae583c3c96a825bd` from
`https://github.com/thatquantguy44/agent-skills.git`. This is the same revision as
the original submodule, without an upstream upgrade. Git's descriptive label is
`0.6.7-10-gf63ec56` (10 commits after the `0.6.7` tag, not the tag itself).

`agents/agent-skills.lock.json` records the exact revision, original Git tree,
license, file count, and SHA-256 of the local content inventory. The digest covers
relative paths, file bytes, executable status, and symlink targets. The integrity
check uses the Python standard library and does not invoke Git or access a network.

```bash
python3 scripts/verify_agent_skills.py
node agents/agent-skills/scripts/validate-skills.js
node agents/agent-skills/scripts/validate-reference-links.js
```

Start with `skills/using-agent-skills/SKILL.md` inside the library and load only
relevant skills. The library supplements project and user instructions.

Do not edit vendored files during application work. Upgrade the snapshot only in
a dedicated reviewed change: obtain the explicitly chosen upstream commit in a
temporary checkout, review its changes, export its tracked files without `.git`
metadata, and replace the snapshot. Preserve the MIT license. Update the lock's
revision/tree and content digest together, run all three validators, review the
normal-file diff, and update this document. No automated update-on-start or
floating branch is configured.


## QuantSmith local reference

`agents/quantsmith.reference.json` records the provided local checkout,
`MARKET_MEDALLION_QUANTSMITH_PATH` override, revision
`5deea85438f6d46a8a14ddb85e3821a65fa62f4e`, original tree and hashes for 61
selected guidance files. `python3 scripts/verify_quantsmith.py` resolves and
checks these without fetching, checking out, installing or modifying the SDK.
`--path` overrides the environment/default location. The pin covers adopted
guidance, not the entire working tree or runtime dependency environment.
Unrelated local drafts are reported; changed pinned guidance/revision fails.

Use the role/standards routing and compatibility notes in `agents/README.md`.
Changing the selected revision or adopting extra guidance is a deliberate
reviewed reference update; changing only the library location can use the path
override. The external SDK's credentials/configuration, hooks and runtime state
remain outside this project. Its agent-skills subset is not used to refresh our
snapshot. Fresh clones include agent-skills but need a matching local QuantSmith
checkout/path to resolve this optional external reference. Hosted CI verifies
pin behavior using temporary fixture repositories, not this machine's SDK path.
