# Master pipeline register

Updated: 2026-10-30, America/New_York.

This is the master index for **pipeline ownership, implementation status and
next work**. It tracks all 20 concrete pipelines/candidates currently recorded
in this repository. The [research roadmap](roadmap.md) retains source-selection
rationale, access reviews and the original 14-addition inventory. Numbered specs
define contracts; [handoffs](handoffs/project_bootstrap.md) record pickup details.
A draft spec or proposed package name does not mean a connector exists.

## Current build sequence and status

AAII is the only implemented pipeline. Its local completion and package cleanup
are on `feature/pipeline-completion`. CFTC TFF futures-only is next on a separate
branch after AAII review/merge. The FX and web-traffic drafts do not silently
change the CFTC → FINRA short-sale volume → OFR STFM sequence.

| Pipeline ID | Purpose | Status | Package under `src/market_data_pipeline/pipelines/` | Contract / evidence | Next scoped work |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `aaii-investor-sentiment` | Weekly investor sentiment shares and bull/bear spread | Implemented locally; recurring acquisition gated | [`aaii/`](../src/market_data_pipeline/pipelines/aaii/) | [Spec 002](../specs/spec002/README.md), [Spec 003](../specs/spec003/README.md), [checkpoint](handoffs/aaii_checkpoint.md), [runbook](deployment/aaii_runbook.md) | Review/merge completion; establish recurring access and production operations before scheduling. |
| `cftc-cot` | Trader positioning, starting with TFF futures-only | Planned; next implementation | Proposed `cftc/`; absent | [Spec 001](../specs/spec001/README.md), [catalog](catalog/README.md#cftc) | Verify official access/schema/publication contract and write a new numbered implementation spec on its own branch. |
| `finra-short-sale-volume` | Facility-scoped short-sale volume and matched denominators | Planned | Proposed `finra_short_sale_volume/`; absent | [Spec 001](../specs/spec001/README.md), [catalog](catalog/README.md#finra) | Confirm current extraction route, scope, terms and fixtures after CFTC. |
| `ofr-stfm` | Short-term funding and repo measures | Planned | Proposed `ofr_stfm/`; absent | [Spec 001](../specs/spec001/README.md), [catalog](catalog/README.md#ofr) | Select series from metadata and verify provenance/units before implementation. |
| `ecb-fx-reference` | Daily official FX reference rates, ECB first | Existing MacroMedallion coverage confirmed; no local connector | Proposed `fx_reference_rates/`; absent and deferred | [Spec 004](../specs/spec004/README.md), [overlap/gap review](reviews/spec004_macro_medallion/README.md): all nine currencies already stored upstream | Keep ECB ingestion in MacroMedallion; prioritize captured revisions/as-of/replay, exact values/metadata, then FX Gold outputs there. |
| `company-web-traffic` | Company/competitor website visit estimates | Draft; acquisition source unresolved | Proposed `company_web_traffic/`; absent | [Spec 005](../specs/spec005/README.md) | Verify a suitable free source first; paid Similarweb is an optional later decision. |

The [specification index](../specs/README.md) records the FX/web contracts and
user decisions. These documentation additions do not implement either connector
or change the current build priority. Provider alternatives such as Bank of
Canada, BIS, Similarweb and DNS rankings are options within those drafts, not additional implemented
pipelines or interchangeable fallbacks.

## Remaining source candidates

All entries below are **research candidates with no code package or implemented
connector**. Promote one only after the roadmap's access/schema/timing review,
numbered spec and offline-fixture acceptance steps. These entries retain the
original IDs; their research detail remains in the linked roadmap sections.

| Pipeline ID | Dataset / purpose | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sec-fails-to-deliver` | Settlement-failure balances | [Original catalog](catalog/README.md#sec-settlement-failures), [Spec 001](../specs/spec001/README.md) |
| `nyfed-primary-dealers` | Dealer positions, transactions and financing | [Positioning backlog](roadmap.md#additional-positioning-and-market-structure-sources) |
| `ofr-hedge-fund-monitor` | Aggregate hedge-fund leverage, liquidity and financing | [Positioning backlog](roadmap.md#additional-positioning-and-market-structure-sources) |
| `finra-otc-transparency` | ATS/non-ATS activity and venue concentration | [Positioning backlog](roadmap.md#additional-positioning-and-market-structure-sources) |
| `sec-nmfp` | Money-market-fund portfolio holdings | [Positioning backlog](roadmap.md#additional-positioning-and-market-structure-sources) |
| `dtcc-public-swaps` | Public swap transaction dissemination | [Positioning backlog](roadmap.md#additional-positioning-and-market-structure-sources) |
| `sec-midas` | Published market-structure metrics and datasets | [Positioning backlog](roadmap.md#additional-positioning-and-market-structure-sources) |
| `sec-nport` | Fund holdings, derivatives and securities lending | [Company/holdings backlog](roadmap.md#later-theme-company-disclosures-and-insider-activity) |
| `fdic-bankfind` | Bank financials, branches and deposits | [Company/holdings backlog](roadmap.md#later-theme-company-disclosures-and-insider-activity) |
| `usda-mymarketnews` | Agricultural market reports and prices | [Alternative-data backlog](roadmap.md#later-theme-broader-free-alternative-data) |
| `stb-rail-service` | Rail service and freight congestion | [Alternative-data backlog](roadmap.md#later-theme-broader-free-alternative-data) |
| `epa-clean-air-markets` | Power-plant emissions and operating data | [Alternative-data backlog](roadmap.md#later-theme-broader-free-alternative-data) |
| `usace-corps-locks` | Inland-waterway vessel movements and delays | [Alternative-data backlog](roadmap.md#later-theme-broader-free-alternative-data) |
| `usaspending` | Federal awards and recipient exposure | [Alternative-data backlog](roadmap.md#later-theme-broader-free-alternative-data) |

SEC insider filings and filing-event metadata remain broader discovery themes;
no concrete new connector contract or package has been selected for them.

## AAII delivery and operations

| Capability | Current evidence / limitation |
| --- | --- |
| CSV and bounded official XLS | Implemented; exact bytes, selection, HTTP provenance and observed revisions retained |
| SQLite and PostgreSQL | Tested against both; local PostgreSQL on port 55438 holds 2,046 reported dates through 2026-10-22 |
| Historical backfill | Implemented; three invalid rows explicitly quarantined; partial audit and quality report retained |
| Parquet | Committed typed snapshots, `current.json` publication and dry-run-first retention |
| Recovery | Owned-state/Bronze backup, empty-target restore and offline replay verified |
| Dagster | Pipeline-owned asset/job, local and live schedules; both schedules stopped |
| Freshness and retries | Configurable overlapping weekly bounds, bounded HTTP attempts and local health command |
| Databricks/Delta | Publisher/notebook implemented; live workspace behavior unverified |
| Production operations | Recurring acquisition rights, daemon/workers, external alerts and off-machine backup policy remain open |

No pipeline is represented as a deployed production service. Raw provider data,
local runtime config, passwords and backup packages remain outside Git.

## Package ownership and maintenance

Every implemented pipeline gets its own Python subpackage immediately beneath
`src/market_data_pipeline/pipelines/`, using a valid snake_case name. New provider
packages must not be created directly under `src/market_data_pipeline/`. Each
pipeline owns its manifest contract, parsers, transforms, acquisition, tables,
publication, recovery, CLI and scheduler assets. Only provider-independent helpers belong in `shared/`.
See the [layout and import migration guide](development/pipeline_layout.md).

Update this register whenever a pipeline is added, scoped, implemented, deployed
or retired. Record the stable pipeline ID, actual package path, spec, verification,
operational status and next task. Keep dataset grain, date basis, access policy
and revisions source-specific. An absent package stays explicitly absent; avoid
placeholder connectors that make planned sources look implemented. Future
manifests/resources/fixtures remain source-scoped in their existing directories.
